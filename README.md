# Réduitus - A Journey in a Miniature World
## Description
This project was developed as part of a course at the School of Business and Engineering Vaud (HEIG-VD). The goal of this project is to learn object-oriented programming using UML.

## Story
You come home after a tough day at HEIG-VD, where you encounter Gaborus Sorcierus. The wizard, furious that you submitted your assignments on Sunday at 12:05 PM, condemns you to become a tiny person.
Suddenly, you find yourself reduced to the size of an ant, lost in the midst of your immense fairy garden. The brightly colored plants now seem like giant trees, and the insects flying over them resemble dragons.

Determined to return to your normal size, you set out on a quest to counter Gaborus Sorcierus's spell.
In this world full of dangers, you will need to solve puzzles to unlock all areas of the map and obtain all the potions necessary to regain your size.
